<h1> Sam's Versioning: Samver </h1>

<h2> Stop Abusing Semver </h2>

<p>
I like semver. I work as a systems folk, and I end up neck deep in other peoples' dependencies more often than I would
like. For libraries, semver is pretty good.
</p>

<p>
That said, I've run into a cult of programmers who see semver as the best thing next to Jesus coming back for solving
all their problems. And they go to alllll the meetings. Some things I've heard:

<ul>
  <li> Making an API for an external bank? Put semver in the URL so they can pick their version! </li>
  <li> Oh you're on version 1.124.0 huh? That many commits and not a single breaking change. Right. </li>
  <li> 0.2.191. In a Jenkins job. </li>
  <li> A Helm chart wraps a Docker container which wraps a binary, and two sidecars. They <i>all</i> have different
    semvers. Question for the audience: What broke?</li>
  <li> Tried out Go modules yet? How many 0.0.0-x-y modules can you find. </li>
  <li> Chef Cookbooks. Theres no better way to discover a patch bump was a lie than 2000 servers telling you in slack.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Maybe this is just from working on infrastructure, but if you make an API, don't break it. Make a new thing, name it
something else, figure out the migration that makes sense for you and your customers. And if you're communicating major
releases in a better way, theres probably a good chance you could learn to communicate features and bugfixes in better
ways than trying to encode them into a single number.
</p>

<p>
I'd also like to note when dealing with automated CI/CD pipelines, the developer must always specify the semver to the
automation. Determining what changed at an interface level in the best case requires scraping contrived commits or doc
files in the repository, but for most of our industry you can assume a human is required.
</p>

<h2> A Sane Way Forward </h2>

<p>
Are you releasing software to other developers who are making concious choices on when and how to depend on your software,
as part of a dependency tool (like ruby gems) across an organizational boundary? Then maybe use semver.
</p>

<h4> OTHERWISE </h4>

<p>
When trying to communicate a feature or a bugfix, whats easier, "/foo was added in version 27" or "/foo was added in
2008.02.28" ?
</p><!–– 23 skidoo ––>

<p><li>
Right, so <b> lets use a date. </b>
</p></li>

<p>
Who's date? The date the customer sees it or the date the developer wrote it? Hopefully you have a continuous deployment
pipeline in place, in which the customer gets an evergreen version without thinking about it, in which case our versioning
should be developer centric.
</p>

<p><li>
So <b> lets use the commit date of the code.</b> (All artifacts are generated from source control right?)
</p></li>

<p><li>
But which branch? Oh no. So <b> lets add the commit sha.</b> But not too long there.
</p></li>

<p><li>
  <b> Oh and I want it sortable. </b>
</p></li>

So lets use:
<h1> YEARMONTHDAYHOURMINUTE-SHORTGITSHA, ex: 201909031732-aa314da </h1>

<p>
<pre>

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# -- samver
# -- in a git repo, spits out a good version

if date --version 2>/dev/null; then
  # GNU
  echo $(date --utc --date="$(git show -s --format=%ci)" +%Y%m%d%H%M)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
else
  # BSD
  echo $(date -u -j -f %s $(git show -s --format=%ct) +%Y%m%d%H%M)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
fi
</pre>
</p>
